Sample to demonstrate the use of Security Token Service
===============================================================================

Please refer sample-guide.html for detailed instructions Security Token Service on WSAS Documentation.

Pre-requisite:
You need to download Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength
Jurisdiction Policy Files 5.0 from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp
and copy the two jar files from the extracted jce directory
(local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar) to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security.

Please follow the given steps:

0.) To configure STS you need to have a role having manage-security permission

1.) Setup the sample by running the given Apache Ant build.
    $ ant

2.) Start WSO2 WSAS (If you haven't already started it)

3.) Log into WSO2 WSAS administration console.

4.) Select "wso2carbon-sts" service and setup security scenario "Sign and encrypt - X509 Authentication" on it.
    Make sure wso2carbon.jks keystore (wso2carbon keystore) is used.

5.) Select "HelloService" service and copy the http service address.


6.) Select "wso2carbon-sts" service and navigate to "Configure STS".
    Paste/type the http endpoint address of "HelloService" service in 
      "Add new trusted service"->"Endpoint Address"
    Select the WSO2WSAS private key's certificate alias (wso2carbon)
    
7.) Select "HelloService" service and setup security scenario 
    "SecureConversation - Sign and Encrypt - Service as STS - Bootstrap policy - Sign and Encrypt , X509 Authentication" on it.
    Makesure wso2carbon.jks keystore (wso2carbon keystore) is used.

7.) Upload sts-sample/conf/client.cert into the wso2carbon keystore using the 
    WSO2WSAS admin console.

8.) Run client
     $ ./run-client.sh <wso2carbon-sts-http-address> <hello-service-http-address>
	OR 
     path\>run-client.bat  <wso2carbon-sts-http-address> <hello-service-http-address>


Notes:

1. Make sure <hello-service-http-address> is exactly the same as the url you added as a trusted service to the STS
